# To solve this path, you'll want to construct your own traversal graph.
# You start in room `0`, which contains exits `['n', 's', 'w', 'e']`.
# Your starting graph should look something like this:
# {
# 0: {'n': '?', 's': '?', 'w': '?', 'e': '?'}
# }

#
# {
# 0: {'n': '?', 's': 5, 'w': '?', 'e': '?'},
# 5: {'n': 0, 's': '?', 'e': '?'}
# }


# okay how i do that is a human first.
# first we start in room zero
# then pick a random direction and follow that direction until it ends
